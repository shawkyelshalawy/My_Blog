### Install MongoDB

To run this project, you need to install the latest version of MongoDB Community Edition first.

Once you install MongoDB, make sure it's running.

### Install the Dependencies

Next, from the project folder, install the dependencies:

    npm i

### Start the Server

    node index.js
